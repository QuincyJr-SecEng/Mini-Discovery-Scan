# Mini-Discovery-Scan
This mini-project demonstrates how I used &lt;strong>Tenable discovery scanning&lt;/strong> to identify live assets across an enterprise-style lab network. The goal was to quickly map the attack surface, validate network visibility, and generate an inventory that can be used for tagging, ownership, and prioritization in a Vulnerability Management program
